  <h1 class="text-center mt-2">Commercial Laundry</h1>

  <h3 class="mt-5 mx-5">Commercial Laundry Services for Aviation and Airport Services</h3>
  <p class="mx-5">Located a mile from SeaTac International Airport we are well equipped to provide laundry services to travelers and SeaTac service providers and airport vendors. Our quick turnaround and nearby locations ensure your laundry is ready when needed.</p>
  
    <h3 class="mt-5 mx-5">Commercial Laundry Services for Airbnbs, VRBOs, and other Vacation Rentals</h3>
    <p class="mx-5">If you own or run an Airbnb or other type of vacation rental then you are probably always doing laundry. If your rental is an entire house then you have to wash everything from dish towels to comforters. Plus you have to work around the schedule of your guests constantly coming and going. Our Airbnb laundry service will work with your schedule to make sure that you have clean towels and linens when you need them.</p>
    
    <h3 class="mt-5 mx-5">Commercial Laundry Services for Medical Facilities</h3>
    <p class="mx-5">Medical facilities are held to a higher standard of cleanliness then most businesses. Everything must be cleaned and sanitized. Our medical laundry service will get everything that you need clean and pristine. We will wash whatever you need laundered - scrubs, medical jackets, sheets, towels, and more. We will work with whatever type of medical practice you have - dentist offices, chiropractic offices, medical clinics, hospitals, veterinary clinics and more. Entrust us with your laundry.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mx-5">Commercial Laundry Services for Spas and Gyms</h3>
    <p class="mx-5">Spas, gyms, and health clubs go through a ton of towels a day. And those towels tend to get pretty nasty. At gyms, towels are mostly used to sop up sweat. At spas they get chemicals like hair dye and nail polish on them. You want to make sure that your towels are laundered right so that they look and smell great for your next customers. Our towel cleaning service will make sure that they look as good as new.</p>
  
    <h3 class="mt-5 mx-5">Commercial Laundry Services for Hotels and Motels</h3>
    <p class="mx-5">Hotel and motel rooms are stripped daily and everything in the room must be laundered - sheets, towels, blankets, comforters, area rugs and more. Doing all of that laundry day to day will take a toll on your washers and dryers. Let us help. Our linen cleaning service can do some, or all, of your hotel laundry. Let us lighten your load.</p>
    
    <h3 class="mt-5 mx-5">Commercial Laundry Services for Students</h3>
    <p class="mx-5">Doing laundry at home is much easier then it is in a dorm. In a dorm you often have to climb up or down to the laundry room with a basket full of dirty clothes. If all the machines are in use you have to return at another time. If it's finals time you may forget to do laundry all together until you realize you're out of underwear. If you use our student laundry service it will free up a lot of time and effort on your part.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mx-5">Commercial Laundry Services for Restaurants and Bars</h3>
    <p class="mx-5">Whenever you work with food or drink you are bound to get stains. When you use our restaurant laundry service we will do our very best to make your laundry look new again. We have expert launderers and industrial machines that can help get your linen napkins, tablecloths, aprons and uniforms looking like new again.</p>
